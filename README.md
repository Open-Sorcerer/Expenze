*The Complete Cross-chain Payment Solution:  Split Expenses with Friends, Roommates, and Group Trips Easily.*

## **The Problem It Solves**

**EXPENZE** is a mobile-first, Web3-oriented decentralized application (DApp) providing a cross-chain expense payment solution. It empowers groups - whether friends, colleagues, or hackathon partners - to efficiently split and settle expenses across different blockchain networks. In the Web3 era, the common issue is managing payments in fiat while earnings are predominantly in crypto, particularly from hackathon winnings. EXPENZE addresses the complexity where individuals prefer receiving tokens on various chains.

### **Key Features:**

- **Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized for on-the-go access.
- **Exceptional User Interface**: Focused on providing an engaging and intuitive experience.
- **Cross-Chain Token Transfers**: Enabled by integrating Chainlink CCIP and Zetachain.
- **Off-Chain Expense Calculation**: Ensures that each group member only needs to perform one transaction, enhancing the user experience and saving on gas fees.

## **Challenges We Ran Into**

- **React Native DApp Development**: Integrating wallet connectivity posed a significant challenge.
- **Transaction Simulation**: Creating values for CCIP's **`ccipSend`** and Zetachain's **`onCrossChainCall`**.
- **Omnichain vs. Cross-Chain Contracts**: Deciding the appropriate contract flow and building Omnichain smart contracts on Zetachain.
- **WalletConnect Integration**: Seamlessly integrating WalletConnect and other Web3 wallets into the React Native DApp.
- **Understanding Zetachain**: Grasping the flow and mechanics of Zetachain interactions.
